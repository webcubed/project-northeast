            Pocumtuck, Wampanoag, Cayuga, Cherokee, Huron, Mohawk, Oneida,
            Onondaga, Seneca, Susquehannock, and Tuscarora. These tribes were
            skilled farmers, hunters, and fishermen, and lived in a variety of
            dwellings, including longhouses, wigwams, and tipis. Their cultures
            were rich in traditions, including storytelling, singing, and
            dancing. The most famous confederacy in the region was the Iroquois
            League, which was formed in the 15th century.</span

            Indigenous peoples in the Northeast region of America traditionally
            wore clothing made from natural materials such as animal hides, fur,
            feathers, and plant fibers. Men typically wore a breechcloth in the
            summer and leggings and a tunic or robe in the winter. Women
            typically wore a wrap-around skirt or dress in the summer and
            leggings and a tunic or robe in the winter. Both men and women
            decorated their clothing with a variety of materials and used their
            clothing to communicate their social status and cultural identity.
            Today, many Indigenous peoples in the Northeast continue to wear
            traditional clothing, especially on special occasions.
